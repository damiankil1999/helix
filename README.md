# Lua library for the Helix gamemode on Garry's Mod

This library provides all the types needed to develop and use [Helix](https://github.com/damiankil1999/helix)

The library has been tailored for [sumneko.lua](https://github.com/LuaLS/lua-language-server)

This was made completely manually, if you see anything that is missing feel free to PR.

## TODO:
- Panels
- Hooks
- chat box lib
